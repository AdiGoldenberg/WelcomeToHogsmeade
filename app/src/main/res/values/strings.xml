    <string name="history_attraction1_name">Over 1,000 years ago</string>
    <string name="history_attraction1_description">According to tradition, Hogsmeade was founded over a thousand years ago,
        around the same time as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, by medieval wizard Hengist of Woodcroft as he
        was fleeing persecution by Muggles.</string>

    <string name="history_attraction4_description">
        Harry Potter\'s first visit to the village (outside the train station) occurred during the winter of 1993.
        Because he ran away from his guardians, the Dursleys, he was unable to acquire permission to go,
        and he visited with the aid of the Marauder\'s Map.
        After Draco Malfoy reported to Snape that he had seen Harry in Hogsmeade
        (when the hood of the invisibility cloak fell off of Harry\'s head) Remus Lupin covered for him but confiscated
        the Marauder\'s Map preventing Harry from visiting Hogsmead again for the remainder of the school year.
        Neville Longbottom also lost his visitation rights for writing down the passwords to Gryffindor Tower,
        which were stolen by Crookshanks, Hermione Granger\'s cat, and used by Sirius Black.
        Later, Sirius, as Harry\'s godfather, gave written permission for Harry to visit the village.
